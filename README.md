# SFSymbolsGenerator
The sample app which generates images for sfsymbols.com

## Running
Note that this app requires Xcode 11 and macOS Catalina which, at the time of writing, are beta software.

Clone the repo, cd into the directory, `xed .`, and build and run the app. The images will be exported to the simulator's container.
